# Exploring the utility of Google Calendar
*By Sage Becker – November 10, 2025*

I wanted to start using Google Calendar to see if it would be useful in my day to day activities. I initially did a Google search for it and sure enough it was immediately available to select.

Shortly there after, since I was already logged in using a google email through Google Chrome, I was met with a warm and inviting page that only asked for my theming preference.

I was suprised that there was very little required of me to start using Google Calendar, I was already logged in after all. First, I wanted to set a reminder to buy groceries. My goal was simple, add something to remind me to purchase *eggs, milk, and bread*. I clicked Create, then task, expecting it to behave like an event. It looked straightforward because I could set the date, time, and details, and I saw it appear on my calendar immediately.

Selecting the task directly inside of the calendar was very easy and the path to editing the date or time was clear.

Later, I went to search for the “grocery” to double-check when I scheduled it, but to my surprise, nothing came up.

I assumed I had done something wrong, so I checked the **Tasks view** and found my entry there — but it still wouldn’t appear in the regular calendar search results. Out of curiosity, I created another entry, this time as an **Event**, and searched again. Now it instantly appeared.

That’s when I realized that Google Calendar treats Tasks and Events completely differently, even though they *look identical* on the calendar. This broke my **mental model** — the way I intuitively expect something to work based on past experience. I assumed Tasks and Events would behave the same because they’re presented the same way, but they don’t.

The design does have strengths: it provides clear **feedback**, and the **affordance** of the “Create” button makes it obvious how to start adding something. But the inconsistency between Tasks and Events creates confusion and forces the user to remember which type of entry they made, rather than trusting the interface to organize everything seamlessly.

If I were redesigning this, I’d make Tasks searchable alongside Events or add a small note that says, “Tasks aren’t included in search results.” A simple hint or filter toggle would make the experience feel more transparent and reduce frustration.

Overall, this small moment in Google Calendar taught me how important it is for a product to **match the user’s expectations**. Even well-designed tools can feel unreliable when their logic doesn’t line up with how people naturally think.
